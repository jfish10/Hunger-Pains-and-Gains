  <p class="lead" class="text-center">These days, I try to structure my life around these 5 main things:</p>
  <ol>
      <li> Spending time with family and friends and maintaining a positive outlook on life. </li>
      <li> Learning computer science to reach my goal of becoming a software engineer.</li>
      <li> Learning how to play the ukulele (at a non-embarassing level).</li>
      <li> Loading up on any and all news related to foreign policy, economics, and global security.</li>
      <li> Staying healthy and active. Taking risks. </li>
      
   </ol>
 
   Besides striving towards the above passions/goals, I'm a Projects Specialist for Lyft in the beautiful city of San Francisco, 
   where I work with data to help keep the company's engine humming (pun definitely intended). Prior to Lyft, I was a Risk & Fraud Analyst
   for Ross Stores, Inc. It was there that I realized how exciting (and financially secure/lucrative)
   a career in software development could be, and from that point forward, I've been focused on the process.

 <div id="bsummary"> <h3>Miscellaneous Facts About Me</h3>
  
   <p>Outside of my professional aspirations, I love mentoring youth, playing basketball (and rooting for the Lakers, of course),
    working hard to maintain an active lifestyle, and eating good food. Sushi, poke, and Mexican food are the foods that I cannot
    live without, and I try my best to visit family in Japan every year. I played water polo in high school,
    and whenever I'm near an ocean, I almost always end up either windsurfing, bodyboarding, snorkeling, or all three. 
    Prior to graduating from college, I took a year off to
    write for Business Insider (as well as Affairs Today, a global student-run news site that had a good run but is now unfortunately defunct).</p></div>
