  <div id="asummary"><p>
    Hiya! I'm Jonathan Fisher, and you've found your way onto my webpage. It's mostly professional,
    but besides being able to look up all the standard stuff such as my resume, publications, projects, and contact info,
    I'll also try to write(key word = <strong> trying </strong>) weekly blog posts on the steps I take on a daily basis
    to reach my professional goal of becoming a software engineer. My reasoning for doing so is twofold: First, I hope to keep myself
    on track and motivated by adhering to a routine, both in keeping the blog up to date and improving my skills on a daily basis. Second, I'd love for
    others to use my experiences as a stepping-stone to reach their own professional goals, regardless of how much work it takes to get there.<br>
    
    These days, I try to structure my life around these 5 main things:<br>
    <ol>
      <li> Learning computer science in order to become a software engineer.</li>
      <li> Learning how to play the ukulele (at a non-embarassing level).</li>
      <li> Loading up on any and all news related to foreign policy, economics, and global security.</li>
      <li> 
   </ol>
    
   Besides striving towards the above passions/goals, I'm a Projects Specialist for Lyft in the beautiful city of San Francisco, 
   where I work with data to help keep the company's engine humming (pun definitely intended). Prior to Lyft, I was a Risk & Fraud Analyst
   for Ross Stores, Inc. It was there that I realized how exciting (and financially secure)
   a career in software development could be, and from that point forward, I've been focused on the process.

 <div id="bsummary"> <h3>Miscellaneous Facts About Me</h3>
  
   <p>Outside of my professional aspirations, I love mentoring youth, playing basketball (and rooting for the Lakers, of course),
    working hard to maintain an active lifestyle, and eating good food. Sushi, poke, and Mexican food are the foods that I cannot
    live without, and I try my best to visit family in Japan every year. I played water polo in high school,
    and whenever I'm near an ocean, I always get the itch to windsurf. 
    Prior to graduating from college, I took a year off to
    write for Business Insider (and Affairs Today, a student-run news site which had a good run but is now unfortunately defunct).</p></div>
