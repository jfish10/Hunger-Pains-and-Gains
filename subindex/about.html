  <ol>
    <p class="lead">
      <li> I try my best to spend time with family and friends and maintain a positive outlook on life. </li>
      <li>I've fallen in love with everything data structures and problem solving. I may be getting stuck on LC easy's right now, but ask me how I'm doing 1 year from now ;). </li>
      <li> My favorite instrument in the world is the saxophone, but I haven't played it in years (I'd love to get back to playing jazz music again).</li>
      <li> I'm a news junkie - I love loading up on any and all news related to foreign policy, economics, sports, global affairs/security, technology, and more.</li>
     <li> My go-to sources for news are the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>Huffington Post</i>, <i>Business Insider</i>, <i>Gizmodo</i>, <i>Wired</i>, <i>The Economist</i>, <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>ESPN</i>, <i>SilverScreenAndRoll</i>, <del><i>Deadspin</i></del>, <i>Lifehacker</i>, <i>Reddit</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, and <i>The New Yorker</i>.
     <li>Sometimes, as evidenced above, I have a habit of reading news articles for hours instead of going out and simply living life.</li>
     <li> My favorite programming language is Java. It may be verbose and at times clunky (who doesn't love generics?), but as someone who uses a mechanical keyboard and loves the sound of the clicking and clacking of keys, Java can't be beat.</li>
     <li> My day-to-day involves working in SQL and Excel. I love everything about databases and data and if I could have a career working purely with SQL, I'd jump on it without hesitation.</li>
     <li> One of my favorite restaurants is Buca Di Beppo. Large portions, white cheese pizza, and complimentary bread - it can't be beat.</li>
     <li> My favorite sport in the world is basketball, and I'm a die-hard Lakers fan, ever since the Kobe-Shaq championship years. Can't wait to see the Lebron-AD pick and rolls this year.</li>
     <li> I'm not a fan of horror movies (hate them), but I'll watch them occasionally just to give my courage a bit of a pop-quiz, so to speak.</li>
     <li> My favorite food in the world is ramen, followed by soba and bean and cheese burritos. The simple life is often the best life.</li>
     <li> Prior to graduating from college, I took a year off to write for Business Insider (as well as write for Affairs Today, a global student-run news site that had a good readership but is now unfortunately defunct).</li>
     <li> Favorite type of tea? Green tea, hands down.</li>
     <li> After I retire, I would love to spend the rest of my life reading and writing as many books, articles, and stories as time will allow.</li>
