   <h1>A Quick Summary About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hiya! I'm Jonathan Fisher, and these days, I'm all about improving my knowledge, skills, and confidence in three main areas:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Effectively learning computer science (using Python and C++) in order to become a software engineer.</li>
      <li>Learning how to play the ukulele (at a non-embarassing level).</li>
      <li> Loading up on any and all news related to foreign policy, economics, and global security.</li>
   </ol>
   Besides striving towards the above passions/goals, I'm a Projects Specialist for Lyft in the beautiful city of San Francisco, 
   where I work with data to help keep the company's engine humming (pun definitely intended). Prior to Lyft, I was a Risk & Fraud Analyst
   for Ross Stores, Inc. It was there that I realized how exciting (and financially secure)
   a career in software development could be, and from that point forward, I've been focused on the process.

  <h3>Miscellaneous Facts About Me</h3>
  <p>Outside of my professional aspirations, I love mentoring youth, playing basketball (and rooting for the Lakers, of course),
    working hard to maintain an active lifestyle, and eating good food. Sushi, poke, and Mexican food are the foods that I cannot
    live without, and I try my best to visit family in Japan every year. I played water polo in high school,
    and whenever I'm near an ocean, I always get the itch to windsurf. 
    Prior to graduating from college, I took a year off to
    write for Business Insider (and Affairs Today, a student-run news site which is now unfortunately defunct).
